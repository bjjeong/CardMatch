# Factr Coding Exercise
Built with React-Redux.

For this coding challenge you will be creating a simple matching game using React/Redux. Upon starting the game you should generate a grid of squares that reveal an image when selected by the user. If the user selected images donâ€™t match, then flip images back over. The game should be timed. If the user has matched up all of the image before the timer runs out, then the user wins.
